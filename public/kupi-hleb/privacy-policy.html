    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the <strong>купи хлеб</strong> (Buybread)
      app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was
      created by Nuril Baradusov (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a
      Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>

    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    <p>
      The Application uses your Apple iCloud account to store and share drawings
      with your paired friend. No other personal information is collected.
      Registration is not required to use the Application — it uses your
      existing iCloud account.
    </p>

    <h2>iCloud Data</h2>
    <p>
      The Application uses Apple's iCloud service to enable sharing drawings
      between paired users. The following data is stored in iCloud:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Drawings you create and send</li>
      <li>Pairing information to connect with your friend</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is stored on Apple's iCloud servers and is governed by
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank"
        >Apple's Privacy Policy</a
      >. Data is only shared with the specific user you pair with — it is not
      publicly accessible or shared with any other third parties.
    </p>
    <p>The Service Provider does not have access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>
      Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the
      device?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Application does not collect precise information about the location
      of your mobile device.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the
      Application?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your drawings are only shared with the friend you explicitly pair with
      using the Application. No data is shared with any other third parties. The
      Service Provider does not have access to your drawings or iCloud data.
    </p>

    <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
    <p>
      You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by
      uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be
      available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application
      marketplace or network.
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete your data from iCloud, you can unpair within the Application or
      manage your iCloud storage through your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to
      children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to
      never submit any personally identifiable information through the
      Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and
      legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
      enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
      personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
      Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
      child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service
      Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the
      Service Provider (<a href="mailto:baradusovnh@gmail.com"
        >baradusovnh@gmail.com</a
      >) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also
      be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your
      personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we
      may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality
      of your information. Your drawings and pairing data are protected by
      Apple's iCloud security measures, including encryption in transit and at
      rest.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The
      Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by
      updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult
      this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed
      approval of all changes.
    </p>

    <p class="effective-date">
      This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-12-17
    </p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your
      information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the
      Service Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>

      or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider
