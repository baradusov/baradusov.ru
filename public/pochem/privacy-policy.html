    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the почём app for mobile devices, created
      by Nuril Baradusov as a free service.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
      All user preferences (selected currencies, settings) are stored locally on
      your device and are not accessible to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Application fetches currency exchange rates from a public API
      (jsdelivr.net). This request is made directly from your device; we do not
      operate any servers that process your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not collect any personal information from anyone,
      including children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be
      posted on this page.
    </p>
